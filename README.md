# snmp-elixir

[![Build Status](https://gitlab.com/jonnystorm/snmp-elixir/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/jonnystorm/snmp-elixir/commits/master)

An SNMP client library for Elixir.

This is my effort to replace the terrible but useful
[net-snmp-elixir](https://gitlab.com/jonnystorm/net-snmp-elixir) with a
facile Elixir wrapper for OTP's harrowing SNMP API.

Many thanks to Dave Martin for his
[post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elixir-lang-talk/lGWGXFoUVvc),
without which I may never have bothered returning to this problem.

## Usage in CLI

```elixir
iex> SNMP.start
iex>
iex> v2_cred = SNMP.credential [:v2c, "public"]
%SNMP.CommunityCredential{
  community: 'public',
  sec_model: :v2c,
  version: :v2
}
iex>
iex> {:ok, base_oid} = SNMP.resolve_object_name_to_oid :sysName
{:ok, [1, 3, 6, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5]}
iex>
iex> SNMP.get base_oid ++ [0], "an-snmp-host.local", v2_cred
[
  {[1, 3, 6, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 0], :"OCTET STRING", 'an-snmp-host'}
]
iex>
iex> v3_cred = SNMP.credential [:v3, :auth_priv, "user", :sha, "authpass", :aes, "privpass",]
%SNMP.USMCredential{
  auth: :sha,
  auth_pass: 'neij44N7cczEFDBzhSwQ',
  priv: :aes,
  priv_pass: '2Q5ZBXHhjGpWlVdYQxmO',
  sec_level: :authPriv,
  sec_model: :usm,
  sec_name: 'nms',
  version: :v3
}
iex> SNMP.walk("ipAddrTable", "an-snmp-host.local", v3_cred) |> Enum.take(1)
[
  {[1, 3, 6, 1, 2, 1, 4, 20, 1, 1, 192, 0, 2, 1], :IpAddress, [192, 0, 2, 1]}
]
```

## Installation

Add `:snmp_ex` to `mix.exs`:

```
def application do
  [ extra_applications: [
      :logger,
      :snmp_ex,
    ],
  ]
end

defp deps do
  [ { :snmp_ex,
      git: "https://gitlab.com/jonnystorm/snmp-elixir.git"
    },
  ]
end
```

And in `config.exs`:

```
config :snmp_ex,
  timeout: 5000,
  max_repetitions: 10
```

## Why another wrapper?

`net-snmp-elixir` was my experimental hack to get something that worked.
I didn't expect it to become one of the top Google results for "elixir snmp"
but it is, which scares me. Elixir may be the best language for network
interaction in existence, but we still need worthy SNMP support.

This project will accept (merge/rebase/squash) *all* contributions.
Contributions that break the build will be reverted.

## TODO

* ~~SNMPv3 USM~~ (requires patched OTP; see issue #6)
* ~~USM engine discovery~~
* SNMP tables
* ~~MIB name resolution~~
* Basic SNMP operations (~~GET~~, ~~GET-NEXT~~, ~~WALK~~, SET)
* Bulk SNMP operations
* ~~Process management (GenServerize)~~
* Make it decent
